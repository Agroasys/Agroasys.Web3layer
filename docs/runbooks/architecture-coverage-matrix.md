# Architecture Coverage Matrix

Snapshot date: 2026-02-22

Scope:
- Source of truth is repository code, merged/open PRs, and roadmap issues.
- KYC/KYB/AML vendor systems are intentionally excluded from this matrix.

Status legend:
- `Done`: acceptance criteria implemented and evidenced in repo/CI.
- `In Progress`: partial implementation with measurable gaps.
- `Blocked`: depends on missing in-repo surface or external dependency.
- `Backlog`: not started.

Production readiness checklist:
- `docs/runbooks/production-readiness-checklist.md`

## Milestone Rollup (evidence-based)

- Milestone A: 56% (issue rollup from A deliverables excluding gate)
- Milestone B: 41% (issue rollup from B deliverables excluding gate)
- Milestone C: 0% (issue rollup from C deliverables excluding gate)

Computation method:
- Use roadmap issue `% Complete` values as authoritative per-deliverable status.
- Recompute after each issue status change or closure.
- Milestone gate issues (#70/#71/#72) track the rollup value and never lead it.

## Gate-to-Row Mapping

- Gate `#70` (Milestone A) maps to:
  Escrow lifecycle + split-settlement safety; Ricardian PDF/hash service; Indexer pipeline + GraphQL schema correctness; Reconciliation drift remediation; SDK typed modules + ABI parity; Release gates + profile health determinism; Core docs + runbooks + developer guidance; AssetHub assets + USDC fee conversion validation; PolkaVM deployment verification + smoke checks.
- Gate `#71` (Milestone B) maps to:
  Dashboard + unified checkout + settlement tracker; Web3Auth signing/session architecture; Oracle trigger + approval + retry controls; Treasury payout queue + audit traceability; Reconciliation reports; Mainnet pilot execution evidence; Hybrid split walkthrough + treasury-to-fiat SOP.
- Gate `#72` (Milestone C) maps to:
  Pilot environment + legal evidence + KPI/demo/case study package; Oracle trigger + approval + retry controls (pilot-safe mode); Treasury payout queue + audit traceability (pilot operations); Infrastructure controls (CI/CD, roadmap governance, release controls).

## Maintenance Rule

Before marking any milestone gate `Done`:
1. Ensure each related row above is either `Done` or explicitly out-of-scope with approval.
2. Ensure each `Done` row references concrete repo evidence (files, tests, merged PRs, CI run).
3. Update gate issue body `% Complete` and project field `% Complete` in the same change.
