# Indexer Poison-Log Recovery

Recovery procedure for an escrow log the indexer could not project.

- **Owner:** Indexer and Data owners
- **Traceability:** WP-3, findings B-06 and FAIL-04 ([Agroasys/Cotsel#651](https://github.com/Agroasys/Cotsel/issues/651))
- **Alert:** `INDEXER_POISON_LOG` (critical, pager route) — see `notifications.md`

## What the control does

The indexer projects escrow logs into Postgres. Subsquid commits the entity
writes and the `squid_processor.status` checkpoint in a **single transaction**,
so an event that is skipped is skipped permanently: the checkpoint moves past
its block and nothing ever reprocesses it.

Three cases are treated as poison and are never skipped:

| Reason            | Cause                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNDECODABLE`     | `parseLog` threw or returned nothing for a log matching an escrow event topic. Usually ABI drift or a contract redeploy at the same address. |
| `UNKNOWN_EVENT`   | The log decoded but no projection handler exists for the event. An event was added to the ABI without a handler.                             |
| `HANDLER_FAILURE` | The projection handler threw.                                                                                                                |

On any of them the indexer:

1. Writes the **complete raw log** to `indexer_quarantined_log` on a separate
   database connection, so the row commits independently.
2. Raises a critical `INDEXER_POISON_LOG` alert.
3. Throws, which rolls back the batch transaction — including the checkpoint
   update — and exits non-zero.

The pipeline then refuses to start while any row is `UNRESOLVED`, so the
checkpoint stays held across restarts. Under `restart: unless-stopped` the
container will crash-loop; that is the intended fail-closed signal, not a
separate fault.

## Symptoms

- `indexer-pipeline` restarting with `quarantine.startup_blocked` or
  `indexer.bootstrap_failed` in its last log lines.
- Reconciliation reporting indexer-side coverage gaps.
- Trade timelines stale from a fixed block onward.

## Recovery

All commands run from `Cotsel/indexer` with the pipeline's database
environment (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`,
`DB_SSL_MODE`).

### 1. Triage

```bash
pnpm --filter indexer run quarantine list
```

Record `blockNumber`, `txHash`, `logIndex`, `reason`, `eventName`, and
`occurrences` in the incident. Do not clear rows before the cause is understood
— they are the only durable evidence of the unprojected event.

### 2. Correct the cause

| Reason            | Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNDECODABLE`     | Confirm `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and the deployed codehash against the reviewed deployment report, regenerate `indexer/src/abi/AgroasysEscrow.json` from the deployed contract, and release a new indexer image. |
| `UNKNOWN_EVENT`   | Add the projection handler for the event and release a new indexer image.                                                                                                                                  |
| `HANDLER_FAILURE` | Fix the handler and release a new indexer image.                                                                                                                                                           |

A correction is not complete until the new image is the one that will restart.

### 3. Re-pin the contract identity (required outside local)

Update `INDEXER_EXPECTED_CONTRACT_CODEHASH` and `INDEXER_EXPECTED_ABI_FINGERPRINT`
so the next drift fails at startup rather than at the first affected log. The
values are printed by the passing preflight as `codehash` and `abiFingerprint`
in the `contract.preflight_passed` log line.

These are **not optional** when `COTSEL_ENVIRONMENT` is `staging` or
`production`: the indexer refuses to start without both, and without
`INDEXER_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` plus a webhook. Unpinned, the preflight
degrades to "is there any code at this address", so a redeploy at the same
address would start cleanly; unrouted, a poison log holds the checkpoint
without paging anyone. In staging both come from Terraform —
`base_sepolia_escrow_codehash`, `escrow_abi_fingerprint`, and the
`notifications-webhook` secret.

### 4. Release the hold

```bash
pnpm --filter indexer run quarantine resolve \
  --block <blockNumber> --tx <txHash> --log-index <logIndex> \
  --note "ABI regenerated from deployed contract; image <digest>"
```

The note is mandatory and becomes part of the evidence record.

### 5. Replay

The checkpoint was held at the block before the poison log, so a restart
normally replays it with no rewind. Rewind only if the checkpoint is already
past the affected range (for example, evidence recovered from an older build):

```bash
pnpm --filter indexer run quarantine rewind --block <blockNumber>
```

Rewind clears hot-block bookkeeping and sets the checkpoint to
`blockNumber - 1` with the `0x` hash sentinel. The runner logs a "migrating
from the FireSquid" warning on the next start — that is expected, and safe
because we only ever rewind to a finalized height.

Restart `indexer-pipeline`. Replay is deterministic: every projection write is
an idempotent upsert, so the same range reproduces the same projection.

### 6. Verify before closing

1. `quarantine list` returns no unresolved rows.
2. The pipeline logs `contract.preflight_passed` and stays up.
3. `OverviewSnapshot.lastProcessedBlock` has advanced past the affected block.
4. Reconciliation runs clean over the affected trade range
   (`pnpm --filter reconciliation run reconcile:once`).
5. The incident records the quarantined row, the correction, the released
   image digest, and the reconciliation result.

## Do not

- Do not `DELETE` from `indexer_quarantined_log` to get the pipeline started.
  The migration's `down` refuses to drop the table while rows are unresolved
  for the same reason.
- Do not resolve a row before the corrected image is the one that will restart;
  the log will simply re-quarantine and reopen the hold.
- Do not edit `squid_processor.status` by hand. Use `quarantine rewind`.
