# Third-Party Notices

This repository depends on third-party open-source packages.

## Node.js Dependencies

- Licenses and attributions for transitive dependencies are provided by each dependency package.

To inspect dependency licenses locally, you can use tooling such as:

```bash

npm view <package-name> license
```

## Container Images
