## Contracts structure

### Contract: `AgroasysEscrow.sol`

Escrow contract implementing secure trade execution with multi-stage fund releases and dispute resolution.


#### **Enums**
**`TradeStatus`**
- `LOCKED`: Initial deposit, funds locked in escrow
- `IN_TRANSIT`: BOL verified, stage 1 funds released (logistics + first tranche)
- `ARRIVAL_CONFIRMED`: Oracle confirms arrival, 24-hour dispute window starts
