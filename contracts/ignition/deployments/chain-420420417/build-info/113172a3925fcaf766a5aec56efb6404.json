This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

This will not\n return address(0) without also returning an error description. Errors are documented using an enum (error type)\n and a bytes32 providing additional information about the error.\n If no error is returned, then the address can be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it.\n Documentation for signature generation:\n - with https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/web3-eth-accounts.html#sign[Web3.js]\n - with https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage[ethers]"

A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."
